# mypizzeria
This project implements a chatbot for a pizzeria that interacts with customers to help them with their queries regarding menu items, takes orders, sums up the total amount, and communicates it back to the customer. The chatbot uses Google Generative AI for language generation and is implemented in Python.
The chatbot will start interacting with you. Type your queries and orders, and type quit to exit the chat.
